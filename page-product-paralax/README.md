# Product Browser with Parallax Effect

This app is a product catalog that uses a parallax style effect for the scrolling of items.

Programmed live on [my Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/mortoray) using [Fuse](https://fusetools.com/).

Key points:

- PageControl with custom transitions
- the difference in scroll speeds of the various product elements
- the point bar at bottom with progress connection
- use of FontAwesome for icons
